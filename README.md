### December data

After reviewing the weather data we can reach the following conclusions:
* June's data shows there would be no problem for this time of year.  With a mean and median of 75 degrees, the weather is suitable for this type of business.
* Temperatures cool in December, but not dramatically.  The mean and median are 71 degrees.
* However, the min temperature is 56 which is likely too cool for surfing.  With 50% of temperatures sinking below the 70 degree mark, December would not be as busy of a month as June.

## Summary
If the surf shop can perform well in the summer season to offset the slower winter months, a surf shop may be sustainable year round.  Further queries could take other weather patterns--like rain--into consideration.  An additional area of analysis might also be conisder the change of season's affect on the tides.
